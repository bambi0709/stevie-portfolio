# My Guessing Game (Year 7)

This is one of my first Python projects.  
I’m building a game where the computer chooses a secret number and I have to guess it.

## What I want my game to do
- Pick a random number
- Let me make guesses
- Tell me if my guess is too high or too low
- Tell me when I'm correct
- Count how many guesses I used

## Skills I will use or learn
- Python input and output
- Variables
- Loops
- If/else logic
- Testing and debugging

## What I learned
(I will fill this in once the project is finished.)

## Ideas to improve my game
(I will add ideas here after I complete the first version.)
